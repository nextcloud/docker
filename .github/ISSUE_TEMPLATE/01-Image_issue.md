<!--
Thanks for reporting issues back to Nextcloud!

When reporting problems, please include your *complete* Docker Compose file (or run commands) and your Nextcloud Server config (e.g. `occ config:list system`). Incomplete reports cause extra work for all parties involved and delay resolution.

Note: This is the issue tracker of the official Nextcloud **Docker image**, please do NOT use this to report issues with Docker or Nextcloud Server itself. You can find help debugging your system on our forums: https://help.nextcloud.com/ or https://forums.docker.com/.

To learn more about official images, see https://github.com/docker-library/faq
