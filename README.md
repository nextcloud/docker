⚠️⚠️⚠️ This image is maintained by community volunteers and designed for expert use. For quick and easy deployment that supports the full set of Nextcloud Hub features, use the [Nextcloud All-in-One docker container](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#nextcloud-all-in-one) maintained by Nextcloud GmbH.

# How to use this image
This image is designed to be used in a micro-service environment. There are two versions of the image you can choose from.

The `apache` tag contains a full Nextcloud installation including an apache web server. It is designed to be easy to use and gets you running pretty fast. This is also the default for the `latest` tag and version tags that are not further specified.

The second option is a `fpm` container. It is based on the [php-fpm](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) image and runs a fastCGI-Process that serves your Nextcloud page. To use this image it must be combined with any webserver that can proxy the http requests to the FastCGI-port of the container.

## Getting help

Most Nextcloud Server administrative matters are covered in the official [Nextcloud Admin Manual](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/) or [other official Nextcloud documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com) (which are all routinely updated).

[![Discourse Users](https://img.shields.io/discourse/users?server=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.nextcloud.com&label=Community%20Forum&color=blue&link=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.nextcloud.com%2F)](https://help.nextcloud.com/)
[![Discourse Posts](https://img.shields.io/discourse/posts?server=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.nextcloud.com&label=Community%20Forum&color=blue&link=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.nextcloud.com%2F)](https://help.nextcloud.com/)

**If you have any problems or usage questions while using the image, please ask for assistance on the [Nextcloud Community Help Forum](https://help.nextcloud.com)** rather than reporting them as "bugs" (unless they are bugs of course). This helps the 
maintainers (who are volunteers) remain focused on making the image better (rather than responding solely to one-on-one support issues). (Tip: Some of the maintainers are also regular responders to help requests 
on the [community help forum](https://help.nextcloud.com/).)

For the image specifically, we provide [some simple deployment examples](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/?tab=readme-ov-file#running-this-image-with-docker-compose) as well as some more extensive [deployment examples](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/tree/master/.examples). In addition, the [community help forum](https://help.nextcloud.com/) has a "how-to" section with further examples of other peoples' container based Nextcloud stacks.

Below you'll find the main documentation for using this image.

## Using the apache image
The apache image contains a webserver and exposes port 80. To start the container type:

```console
$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 nextcloud
```

Now you can access Nextcloud at http://localhost:8080/ from your host system.

WARNING: This example is only suitable for limited testing purposes. Please read on to understand how the image handles storing your data and other aspects you need to consider to establish a full Nextcloud stack.


## Using the fpm image
To use the fpm image, you need an additional web server, such as [nginx](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/nginx.html), that can proxy http-request to the fpm-port of the container. For fpm connection this container exposes port 9000. In most cases, you might want to use another container or your host as proxy. If you use your host you can address your Nextcloud container directly on port 9000. If you use another container, make sure that you add them to the same docker network (via `docker run --network <NAME> ...` or a `docker compose` file). In both cases you don't want to map the fpm port to your host.

```console
$ docker run -d nextcloud:fpm
```

As the fastCGI-Process is not capable of serving static files (style sheets, images, ...), the webserver needs access to these files. This can be achieved with the `volumes-from` option. You can find more information in the [docker compose section](#running-this-image-with-docker-compose).

## Using an external database
By default, this container uses SQLite for data storage but the Nextcloud setup wizard (appears on first run) allows connecting to an existing MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL database. You can also link a database container, e. g. `--link my-mysql:mysql`, and then use `mysql` as the database host on setup. More info is in [the docker compose section](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/?tab=readme-ov-file#running-this-image-with-docker-compose).

## Persistent data
The Nextcloud installation and all data beyond what lives in the database (file uploads, etc.) are stored in the [unnamed docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#adding-a-data-volume) volume `/var/www/html`. The docker daemon will store that data within the docker directory `/var/lib/docker/volumes/...`. That means your data is saved even if the container crashes, is stopped or deleted.

A named Docker volume or a mounted host directory should be used for upgrades and backups. To achieve this, you need one volume for your database container and one for Nextcloud.

Nextcloud:
- `/var/www/html/` folder where all Nextcloud data lives
```console
$ docker run -d \
-v nextcloud:/var/www/html \
nextcloud
```

Database:
- `/var/lib/mysql` MySQL / MariaDB Data
- `/var/lib/postgresql/data` PostgreSQL Data
```console
$ docker run -d \
-v db:/var/lib/mysql \
mariadb:10.11
```

### Additional volumes

If you want to get fine grained access to your individual files, you can mount additional volumes for data, config, your theme and custom apps. The `data`, `config` files are stored in respective subfolders inside `/var/www/html/`. The apps are split into core `apps` (which are shipped with Nextcloud and you don't need to take care of) and a `custom_apps` folder. If you use a custom theme it would go into the `themes` subfolder.

Overview of the folders that can be mounted as volumes:

- `/var/www/html` Main folder, needed for updating
- `/var/www/html/custom_apps` installed / modified apps
- `/var/www/html/config` local configuration
- `/var/www/html/data` the actual data of your Nextcloud
- `/var/www/html/themes/<YOUR_CUSTOM_THEME>` theming/branding

If you want to use named volumes for all of these, it would look like this:
```console
$ docker run -d \
-v nextcloud:/var/www/html \
-v custom_apps:/var/www/html/custom_apps \
-v config:/var/www/html/config \
-v data:/var/www/html/data \
-v theme:/var/www/html/themes/<YOUR_CUSTOM_THEME> \
nextcloud
```

If you'd prefer to use bind mounts instead of named volumes, for instance, when working with different device or network mounts for user data files and configuration:
```console
$ docker run -d \
-v /path/on/host/to/folder/nextcloud:/var/www/html \
-v /path/on/host/to/folder/custom_apps:/var/www/html/custom_apps \
-v /path/on/host/to/folder/config:/var/www/html/config \
-v /path/on/host/to/folder/data:/var/www/html/data \
-v /path/on/host/to/folder/theme:/var/www/html/themes/<YOUR_CUSTOM_THEME> \
nextcloud
```

Here’s the same example using Docker's more detailed `--mount`. Note that with `-v` or `--volume`, the specified folders are created automatically if they don't exist. However, when using `--mount` for bind mounts, the directories must already exist on the host, or Docker will return an error.
```console
$ docker run -d \
--mount type=bind,source=/path/on/host/to/folder/nextcloud,target=/var/www/html \
--mount type=bind,source=/path/on/host/to/folder/custom_apps,target=/var/www/html/custom_apps \
--mount type=bind,source=/path/on/host/to/folder/config,target=/var/www/html/config \
--mount type=bind,source=/path/on/host/to/folder/data,target=/var/www/html/data \
--mount type=bind,source=/path/on/host/to/folder/theme,target=/var/www/html/themes/<YOUR_CUSTOM_THEME> \
nextcloud
```
The examples above use figurative directory `/path/on/host/to/folder/` for bind mounts. Please modify the paths by using either a relative or absolute path.

NOTE: Do not confuse the `apps` and `custom_apps` folders. These folders contain different sets of apps, and mixing them will result in a broken installation. The former contains "shipped" apps, which come with Nextcloud Server. The latter contains apps you install from the App Store.

### Custom volumes

If mounting additional volumes under `/var/www/html`, you should consider:
- Confirming that [upgrade.exclude](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/blob/master/upgrade.exclude) contains the files and folders that should persist during installation and upgrades; or
- Mounting storage volumes to locations outside of `/var/www/html`.

**Data inside the main folder (`/var/www/html`) will be overridden/removed during installation and upgrades, unless listed in [upgrade.exclude](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/blob/master/upgrade.exclude).** The additional volumes officially supported are already in that list, but custom volumes will need to be added by you. We suggest mounting custom storage volumes outside of `/var/www/html` and if possible read-only so that making this adjustment is unnecessary. If you must do so, however, you may build a custom image with a modified `/upgrade.exclude` file that incorporates your custom volume(s).


## Accessing the Nextcloud command-line interface (`occ`)

To use the [Nextcloud command-line interface](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/occ_command.html) (aka. `occ` command):
```console
$ docker exec --user www-data CONTAINER_ID php occ
```
or for docker compose:
```console
$ docker compose exec --user www-data app php occ
```
or even shorter:
```console
$ docker compose exec -u33 app ./occ
```
Note: substitute `82` for `33` if using the Alpine-based images.

## Viewing the Nextcloud configuration (`config.php`)

The image takes advantage of Nextcloud's [Multiple config.php support](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html#multiple-config-php-file) to inject auto configuration environment variables and set image specific config values.

This means that merely viewing your `config.php` will not give you an accurate view of your running config. Instead, you should use Nextcloud's [`occ config:list system` command](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/occ_command.html#config-commands-label) to get get a complete view of your merged configuration. This has the added benefit of automatically omitting sensitive values such as passwords and secrets from the output by default (e.g. useful for shared publicly or assisting others when troubleshooting or reporting a bug).

```console
$ docker compose exec -u33 app ./occ config:list system
```

The `--private` flag can also be specified, in order to output all configuration values including passwords and secrets.

## Auto configuration via environment variables

The Nextcloud image supports auto configuration of the Nextcloud Server installation via environment variables. You can preconfigure everything that would otherwise be prompted for by the Nextcloud Installation Wizard (as well as a few other key parameters relevant to initial installation). 

### Database parameters

To enable auto configuration, define your database connection via the following environment variables. If you set any group of values (i.e. all of `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_HOST`), they will not be requested via the Installation Wizard on first run. 

You must specify all of the environment variables for a given database or the database environment variables defaults to SQLITE. ONLY use one database type!

__SQLite__:
- `SQLITE_DATABASE` Name of the database using sqlite

__MYSQL/MariaDB__:
- `MYSQL_DATABASE` Name of the database using mysql / mariadb.
- `MYSQL_USER` Username for the database using mysql / mariadb.
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD` Password for the database user using mysql / mariadb.
- `MYSQL_HOST` Hostname of the database server using mysql / mariadb.

__PostgreSQL__:
- `POSTGRES_DB` Name of the database using postgres.
- `POSTGRES_USER` Username for the database using postgres.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` Password for the database user using postgres.
- `POSTGRES_HOST` Hostname of the database server using postgres.

As an alternative to passing sensitive information via environment variables, `_FILE` may be appended to the previously listed environment variables, causing the initialization script to load the values for those variables from files present in the container. See [Docker secrets](#docker-secrets) section below for details.

### Initial admin account

If you specify all the variables for your database type (above), you can also auto configure your initial admin user and password (only works if you set both):

- `NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER` Name of the Nextcloud admin user.
- `NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` Password for the Nextcloud admin user.

Specifying a complete database and admin credential config set at initial deployment will result in a fully automated installation (i.e. bypassing the web-based Nextcloud Installation Wizard).

Addition parameters may also be set at installation time and are described below.

### Custom Data directory (`datadirectory`)

If you don't want to use the default data directory (`datadirectory`) location, you can set a custom one:

- `NEXTCLOUD_DATA_DIR` (default: `/var/www/html/data`) Configures the data directory where nextcloud stores all files from the users.

### Trusted domains (`trusted_domains`)

One or more trusted domains can be set through environment variable, too. They will be added to the configuration after install.

- `NEXTCLOUD_TRUSTED_DOMAINS` (not set by default) Optional space-separated list of domains

### Image specific

The install and update script is only triggered when a default command is used (`apache-foreground` or `php-fpm`). If you use a custom command you have to enable the install / update with

- `NEXTCLOUD_UPDATE` (default: `0`)

You might want to make sure the htaccess is up to date after each container update. Especially on multiple swarm nodes as any discrepancy will make your server unusable.

- `NEXTCLOUD_INIT_HTACCESS` (not set by default) Set it to true to enable run `occ maintenance:update:htaccess` after container initialization.

### Redis Memory Caching

To use Redis for memory caching as well as PHP session storage, specify the following values and also add a [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) container to your stack. See the [examples](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/tree/master/.examples) for further instructions.

- `REDIS_HOST` (not set by default) Name of Redis container
- `REDIS_HOST_PORT` (default: `6379`) Optional port for Redis, only use for external Redis servers that run on non-standard ports.
- `REDIS_HOST_PASSWORD` (not set by default) Redis password

Check the [Nextcloud documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/caching_configuration.html) for more information.

### E-mail (SMTP) Configuration

To use an external SMTP server, you have to provide the connection details. Note that if you configure these values via Docker, you should **not** use the Nexcloud Web UI to configure external SMTP server parameters. Conversely, if you prefer to use the Web UI, do **not** set these variables here (because these variables will override whatever you attempt to set in the Web UI for these parameters). To configure Nextcloud to use SMTP add:

- `SMTP_HOST` (not set by default): The hostname of the SMTP server.
- `SMTP_SECURE` (empty by default): Set to `ssl` to use SSL, or `tls` to use STARTTLS.
- `SMTP_PORT` (default: `465` for SSL and `25` for non-secure connections): Optional port for the SMTP connection. Use `587` for an alternative port for STARTTLS.
- `SMTP_AUTHTYPE` (default: `LOGIN`): The method used for authentication. Use `PLAIN` if no authentication is required.
- `SMTP_NAME` (empty by default): The username for the authentication.
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` (empty by default): The password for the authentication.
- `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` (not set by default): Set the local-part for the 'from' field in the emails sent by Nextcloud.
- `MAIL_DOMAIN` (not set by default): Set a different domain for the emails than the domain where Nextcloud is installed.

At a minimum, the `SMTP_HOST`, `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` and `MAIL_DOMAIN` parameters must be defined.

Check the [Nextcloud documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/email_configuration.html) for other values to configure SMTP.

### Object Storage (Primary Storage)

By default, Nextcloud stores all files in `/var/www/html/data/` (or whatever custom data directory you've configured). Nextcloud also allows the use of object storages (like OpenStack 
Swift or any Amazon S3-compatible implementation) as *Primary Storage*. This semi-replaces the default storage of files in the data directory. Note: This data directory might still be 
used for compatibility reasons and still needs to exist. Check the [Nextcloud documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/primary_storage.html) for more information.

To use an external S3 compatible object store as primary storage, set the following variables:
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_BUCKET`: The name of the bucket that Nextcloud should store the data in
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_REGION`: The region that the S3 bucket resides in
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_HOST`: The hostname of the object storage server
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_PORT`: The port that the object storage server is being served over
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_KEY`: AWS style access key
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_SECRET`: AWS style secret access key
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_STORAGE_CLASS`: The storage class to use when adding objects to the bucket
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_SSL` (default: `true`): Whether or not SSL/TLS should be used to communicate with object storage server
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_USEPATH_STYLE` (default: `false`): Not required for AWS S3
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_LEGACYAUTH` (default: `false`): Not required for AWS S3
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_OBJECT_PREFIX` (default: `urn:oid:`): Prefix to prepend to the fileid
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_AUTOCREATE` (default: `true`): Create the container if it does not exist
- `OBJECTSTORE_S3_SSE_C_KEY` (not set by default): Base64 encoded key with a maximum length of 32 bytes for server side encryption (SSE-C)

Check the [Nextcloud documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/primary_storage.html#simple-storage-service-s3) for more information.

To use an external OpenStack Swift object store as primary storage, set the following variables:
- `OBJECTSTORE_SWIFT_URL`: The Swift identity (Keystone) endpoint
- `OBJECTSTORE_SWIFT_AUTOCREATE` (default: `false`): Whether or not Nextcloud should automatically create the Swift container
- `OBJECTSTORE_SWIFT_USER_NAME`: Swift username
- `OBJECTSTORE_SWIFT_USER_PASSWORD`: Swift user password
- `OBJECTSTORE_SWIFT_USER_DOMAIN` (default: `Default`): Swift user domain
- `OBJECTSTORE_SWIFT_PROJECT_NAME`: OpenStack project name
- `OBJECTSTORE_SWIFT_PROJECT_DOMAIN` (default: `Default`): OpenStack project domain
- `OBJECTSTORE_SWIFT_SERVICE_NAME` (default: `swift`): Swift service name
- `OBJECTSTORE_SWIFT_REGION`: Swift endpoint region
- `OBJECTSTORE_SWIFT_CONTAINER_NAME`: Swift container (bucket) that Nextcloud should store the data in

Check the [Nextcloud documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/primary_storage.html#openstack-swift) for more information.

### PHP Configuration

To customize PHP limits you can change the following variables:
- `PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT` (default `512M`) This sets the maximum amount of memory in bytes that a script is allowed to allocate. This is meant to help prevent poorly written scripts from eating up all available memory but it can prevent normal operation if set too tight.
- `PHP_UPLOAD_LIMIT` (default `512M`) This sets the upload limit (`post_max_size` and `upload_max_filesize`) for big files. Note that you may have to change other limits depending on your client, webserver or operating system. Check the [Nextcloud documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/big_file_upload_configuration.html) for more information.

### Apache Configuration

To customize the Apache max file upload limit you can change the following variable:
- `APACHE_BODY_LIMIT` (default `1073741824` [1GiB]) This restricts the total
size of the HTTP request body sent from the client. It specifies the number of _bytes_ that are allowed in a request body. A value of **0** means **unlimited**.

Check the [Nextcloud documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/big_file_upload_configuration.html#apache) for more information.

### Using the image behind a reverse proxy and specifying the server host and protocol

By default, the apache image will replace the remote addr (IP address visible to Nextcloud) with the IP address from `X-Real-IP` if the request is coming from a reverse proxy in `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12` or `192.168.0.0/16`. If you want Nextcloud to pick up the server host (`HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST`), protocol (`HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO`) and client IP (`HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`) from a trusted proxy, then disable rewrite IP and add the reverse proxy's IP address to `TRUSTED_PROXIES`.

- `APACHE_DISABLE_REWRITE_IP` (not set by default): Set to 1 to disable rewrite IP.

- `TRUSTED_PROXIES` (empty by default): A space-separated list of trusted proxies. CIDR notation is supported for IPv4.

If the `TRUSTED_PROXIES` approach does not work for you, try using fixed values for overwrite parameters.

- `OVERWRITEHOST` (empty by default): Set the hostname of the proxy. Can also specify a port.
- `OVERWRITEPROTOCOL` (empty by default): Set the protocol of the proxy, http or https.
- `OVERWRITECLIURL` (empty by default): Set the cli url of the proxy (e.g. https://mydnsname.example.com)
- `OVERWRITEWEBROOT` (empty by default): Set the absolute path of the proxy.
- `OVERWRITECONDADDR` (empty by default): Regex to overwrite the values dependent on the remote address.
- `FORWARDED_FOR_HEADERS` (empty by default): HTTP headers with the original client IP address

Check the [Nexcloud documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/reverse_proxy_configuration.html) for more details.

Keep in mind that once set at install time, removing these environment variables later won't remove them from your `config/config.php`, due to how Nextcloud generates and merges the initial configuration at installation time. They can still, however, be removed manually from your `config/config.php`.

### Handling `Warning: /var/www/html/config/$cfgFile differs from the latest version of this image at /usr/src/nextcloud/config/$cfgFile` (aka: Auto configuration and Nextcloud updates)

The image comes with special config files for Nextcloud that set parameters specific to containerized usage (e.g. `upgrade-disable-web.config.php`) or enable auto configuration via environment variables (e.g. `reverse-proxy.config.php`). Not keeping these files up-to-date when this warning appears may cause certain auto configuration environment variables to be ignored or the image to not work as documented or expected.

During a fresh Nextcloud installation, the latest version (from the image) of these files are copied into `/var/www/html/config` so that they are stored within your container's persistent storage and picked up by Nextcloud alongside your local configuration.

The copied files, however, are **not** automatically overwritten whenever you update your environment with a newer Nextcloud image. This is to prevent local changes in `/var/www/html/config` from being unexpectedly overwritten. This may lead to your image-specific configuration files becoming outdated and image functionality not matching that which is documented.

Within each image, the latest version of these config files are located in `/usr/src/nextcloud/config`.

A warning will be generated in the container log output when outdated image-specific configuration files are detected at startup in a running container. When you see this warning, you should manually compare (or copy) the files from `/usr/src/nextcloud/config` to `/var/www/html/config`.
A command to copy these configs would e.g. be:
```console
docker exec <container-name> sh -c "cp /usr/src/nextcloud/config/*.php /var/www/html/config"
```

As long as you have not modified any of the provided config files in `/var/www/html/config` (other than `config.php`) or only added new ones with names that do not conflict with the image specific ones, copying the new ones into place should be safe (but check the source path `/usr/src/nextcloud/config` for any newly named config files to avoid new overlaps just in case).

## Auto configuration via hook folders

There are 5 hooks

- `pre-installation` Executed before the Nextcloud is installed/initiated
- `post-installation` Executed after the Nextcloud is installed/initiated
- `pre-upgrade` Executed before the Nextcloud is upgraded
- `post-upgrade` Executed after the Nextcloud is upgraded
- `before-starting` Executed before the Nextcloud starts

To use the hooks triggered by the `entrypoint` script, either
- Added your script(s) to the individual of the hook folder(s), which are located at the path `/docker-entrypoint-hooks.d` in the container
- Use volume(s) if you want to use script from the host system inside the container, see example.

**Note:** Only the script(s) located in a hook folder (not sub-folders), ending with `.sh` and marked as executable, will be executed.

**Example:** Mount using volumes
```yaml
...
  app:
    image: nextcloud:stable

    volumes:
      - ./app-hooks/pre-installation:/docker-entrypoint-hooks.d/pre-installation
      - ./app-hooks/post-installation:/docker-entrypoint-hooks.d/post-installation
      - ./app-hooks/pre-upgrade:/docker-entrypoint-hooks.d/pre-upgrade
      - ./app-hooks/post-upgrade:/docker-entrypoint-hooks.d/post-upgrade
      - ./app-hooks/before-starting:/docker-entrypoint-hooks.d/before-starting
...
```

# Running this image with `docker compose`
The easiest way to get a fully featured and functional setup is using a `compose.yaml` file. There are too many different possibilities to setup your system, so here are only some examples of what you have to look for.

At first, make sure you have chosen the right base image (fpm or apache) and added features you wanted (see below). In every case, you would want to add a database container and docker volumes to get easy access to your persistent data. When you want to have your server reachable from the internet, adding HTTPS-encryption is mandatory! See below for more information.

## Base version - apache
This version will use the apache variant and add a MariaDB container. The volumes are set to keep your data persistent. This setup provides **no TLS encryption** and is intended to run behind a proxy.

Make sure to pass in values for `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` variables before you run this setup.

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: mariadb:10.11
    restart: always
    command: --transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED --log-bin=binlog --binlog-format=ROW
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    restart: always

  app:
    image: nextcloud
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - db
    volumes:
      - nextcloud:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_HOST=db

volumes:
  nextcloud:
  db:
```

Then run `docker compose up -d`, now you can access Nextcloud at http://localhost:8080/ from your host system.

## Base version - FPM
When using the FPM image, you need another container that acts as web server on port 80 and proxies the requests to the Nextcloud container. In this example a simple nginx container is combined with the Nextcloud-fpm image and a MariaDB database container. The data is stored in docker volumes. The nginx container also needs access to static files from your Nextcloud installation. It gets access to all the volumes mounted to Nextcloud via the `volumes` option. The configuration for nginx is stored in the configuration file `nginx.conf`, that is mounted into the container. An example can be found in the examples section [here](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/tree/master/.examples).

This setup provides **no TLS encryption** and is intended to run behind a reverse proxy.

Make sure to pass in values for `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` variables before you run this setup.

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: mariadb:10.11
    restart: always
    command: --transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED --log-bin=binlog --binlog-format=ROW
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    restart: always

  app:
    image: nextcloud:fpm
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - db
    volumes:
      - nextcloud:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_HOST=db

  web:
    image: nginx
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    depends_on:
      - app
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
    volumes_from:
      - app

volumes:
  nextcloud:
  db:
```

Then run `docker compose up -d`, now you can access Nextcloud at http://localhost:8080/ from your host system.

# Docker Secrets

As an alternative to passing sensitive information via environment variables, `_FILE` may be appended to some the previously listed environment variables, causing the initialization script to load the values for those variables from files present in the container. In particular, this can be used to load passwords from Docker secrets stored in `/run/secrets/<secret_name>` files. 

Currently, this is only supported for `NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_USER`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `REDIS_HOST_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `OBJECTSTORE_S3_KEY`, and `OBJECTSTORE_S3_SECRET`. 

If you set any group of `_FILE` based values (i.e. all of `MYSQL_DATABASE_FILE`, `MYSQL_USER_FILE`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE`), their non-`_FILE` counterparts will be ignored (`MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`).

Any files containing secrets must be readable by the UID the container is running Nextcloud as (i.e. `www-data` / `33`).

Example:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB_FILE=/run/secrets/postgres_db
      - POSTGRES_USER_FILE=/run/secrets/postgres_user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/postgres_password
    secrets:
      - postgres_db
      - postgres_password
      - postgres_user
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    restart: always

  app:
    image: nextcloud
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    volumes:
      - nextcloud:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_HOST=db
      - POSTGRES_DB_FILE=/run/secrets/postgres_db
      - POSTGRES_USER_FILE=/run/secrets/postgres_user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/postgres_password
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/nextcloud_admin_password
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER_FILE=/run/secrets/nextcloud_admin_user
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - db
    secrets:
      - nextcloud_admin_password
      - nextcloud_admin_user
      - postgres_db
      - postgres_password
      - postgres_user

volumes:
  db:
  nextcloud:

secrets:
  nextcloud_admin_password:
    file: ./nextcloud_admin_password.txt # put admin password in this file
  nextcloud_admin_user:
    file: ./nextcloud_admin_user.txt # put admin username in this file
  postgres_db:
    file: ./postgres_db.txt # put postgresql db name in this file
  postgres_password:
    file: ./postgres_password.txt # put postgresql password in this file
  postgres_user:
    file: ./postgres_user.txt # put postgresql username in this file
```

# Make your Nextcloud available from the internet
Until here, your Nextcloud is just available from your docker host. If you want your Nextcloud available from the internet adding SSL encryption is mandatory.

## HTTPS - SSL encryption
There are many different possibilities to introduce encryption depending on your setup.

We recommend using a reverse proxy in front of your Nextcloud installation. Your Nextcloud will only be reachable through the proxy, which encrypts all traffic to the clients. You can mount your manually generated certificates to the proxy or use a fully automated solution which generates and renews the certificates for you.

In our [examples](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/tree/master/.examples) section we have an example for a fully automated setup using a reverse proxy, a container for [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate handling, database and Nextcloud. It uses the popular [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) and [acme-companion](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion) containers. Please check the according documentations before using this setup.

# First use
When you first access your Nextcloud, the setup wizard will appear and ask you to choose an administrator account username, password and the database connection (unless of course you've provided all the necessary auto-config config values ahead of time). 

For the database use `db` as host and `nextcloud` as table and user name. Also enter the password you chose in your `compose.yaml` file.

# Update to a newer version
Updating the Nextcloud container is done by pulling the new image, throwing away the old container and starting the new one.

**It is only possible to upgrade one major version at a time. For example, if you want to upgrade from version 14 to 16, you will have to upgrade from version 14 to 15, then from 15 to 16.**

Since all data is stored in volumes, nothing gets lost. The startup script will check for the version in your volume and the installed docker version. If it finds a mismatch, it automatically starts the upgrade process. Don't forget to add all the volumes to your new container, so it works as expected.

```console
$ docker pull nextcloud
$ docker stop <your_nextcloud_container>
$ docker rm <your_nextcloud_container>
$ docker run <OPTIONS> -d nextcloud
```
Beware that you have to run the same command with the options that you used to initially start your Nextcloud. That includes  volumes, port mapping.

When using docker compose your compose file takes care of your configuration, so you just have to run:

```console
$ docker compose pull
$ docker compose up -d
```


# Adding Features
A lot of people want to use additional functionality inside their Nextcloud installation. If the image does not include the packages you need, you can easily build your own image on top of it. Start your derived image with the `FROM` statement and add whatever you like.

```dockerfile
FROM nextcloud:apache

RUN ...

```
The [examples folder](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/blob/master/.examples) gives a few examples on how to add certain functionalities, like including the cron job, smb-support or imap-authentication.

If you use your own Dockerfile, you need to configure your docker compose file accordingly. Switch out the `image` option with `build`. You have to specify the path to your Dockerfile. (in the example it's in the same directory next to the `compose.yaml` file)

```yaml
  app:
    build: .
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - db
    volumes:
      - data:/var/www/html/data
      - config:/var/www/html/config
      - apps:/var/www/html/apps
```

If you intend to use another command to run the image, make sure that you set `NEXTCLOUD_UPDATE=1` in your Dockerfile. Otherwise the installation and update will not work.

```dockerfile
FROM nextcloud:apache

...

ENV NEXTCLOUD_UPDATE=1

CMD ["/usr/bin/supervisord"]
```


**Updating** your own derived image is also very simple. When a new version of the Nextcloud image is available run:

```console
docker build -t your-name --pull .
docker run -d your-name
```

or for docker compose:
```console
docker compose build --pull
docker compose up -d
```

The `--pull` option tells docker to look for new versions of the base image. Then the build instructions inside your `Dockerfile` are run on top of the new image.

# Migrating an existing installation
You're already using Nextcloud and want to switch to docker? Great! Here are some things to look out for:

1. Define your whole Nextcloud infrastructure in a `compose.yaml` file and run it with `docker compose up -d` to get the base installation, volumes and database. Work from there.
2. Restore your database from a mysqldump (db is the name of your database container / service name)
    - To import from a MySQL dump use the following commands
    ```console
    docker compose cp ./database.dmp db:/dmp
    docker compose exec db sh -c "mysql --user USER --password PASSWORD nextcloud < /dmp"
    docker compose exec db rm /dmp
    ```
    - To import from a PostgreSQL dump use to following commands
    ```console
    docker compose cp ./database.dmp db:/dmp
    docker compose exec db sh -c "psql -U USER --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on nextcloud < /dmp"
    docker compose exec db rm /dmp
    ```
3. Edit your config.php
    1. Set database connection
        - In case of MySQL database
        ```php
        'dbhost' => 'db:3306',
        ```
        - In case of PostgreSQL database
        ```php
        'dbhost' => 'db:5432',
        ```
    2. Make sure you have no configuration for the `apps_paths`. Delete lines like these
        ```php
        'apps_paths' => array (
            0 => array (
                'path' => OC::$SERVERROOT.'/apps',
                'url' => '/apps',
                'writable' => true,
            ),
        ),
        ```
    3. Make sure to have the `apps` directory non writable and the `custom_apps` directory writable
        ```php
        'apps_paths' => array (
          0 => array (
            'path' => '/var/www/html/apps',
            'url' => '/apps',
            'writable' => false,
          ),
          1 => array (
            'path' => '/var/www/html/custom_apps',
            'url' => '/custom_apps',
            'writable' => true,
          ),
        ),
        ```
    4. Make sure your data directory is set to /var/www/html/data
        ```php
        'datadirectory' => '/var/www/html/data',
        ```
4. Copy your data (`app` is the name of your Nextcloud container / service name):
    ```console
    docker compose cp ./data/ app:/var/www/html/
    docker compose exec app chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/data
    docker compose cp ./theming/ app:/var/www/html/
    docker compose exec app chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/theming
    docker compose cp ./config/config.php app:/var/www/html/config
    docker compose exec app chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/config
    ```
    If you want to preserve the metadata of your files like timestamps, copy the data directly on the host to the named volume using plain `cp` like this:
    ```console
    cp --preserve --recursive ./data/ /path/to/nextcloudVolume/data
    ```
5. Copy only the custom apps you use (or simply redownload them from the web interface):
    ```console
    docker compose cp ./custom_apps/ app:/var/www/html/
    docker compose exec app chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/custom_apps
    ```

## Migrating from a non-Alpine image to an Alpine image

If you already use one of our non-Alpine images, but want to switch to an Alpine-based image, you may experience permissions problems with your existing volumes. This is because the Alpine images uses a different user ID for `www-data`. 
So, you must change the ownership of the `/var/www/html` (or `$NEXTCLOUD_DATA_DIR`) folder to be compatible with Alpine:

```console
docker exec container-name chown -R www-data:root /var/www/html
```

After changing the permissions, restart the container and the permission errors should disappear.
